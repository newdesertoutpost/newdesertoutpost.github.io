New Desert Outpost is a diverse collection of people from a variety of backgrounds and ages. Most of our campers come in through referrals, but we're always open to meeting new people who want to help us make our camp thrive.

# This Is Us
* We are a seasoned community of Burning Man explorers who are dedicated to inspiring our fellow wanderers - both new burners and those jaded by years of experience - to discover new parts of Black Rock City.
* We delight in building fun interactive objects and events that delight and connect our fellow burners with the experiences we love most at Burning Man
* Burning man to us is a source of creative freedom, an exercise in self reliance and team work and an opportunity to embrace community. We seek to make this camp a reflection of everything we love about the burn.
* We are excited to bring new people into our community who like engaging in community and creating fun experiences for others. We don’t care if you’ve never created anything, so long as you come with a willingness to help
* Although nobody in the camp is obliged to remain a unit and everybody takes their own burn experience, if you’re looking for a really solo burn with no accountability to anybody else, this isn’t the camp for you.
* Because we’re young and small, the whole camp needs to share in running day to day logistics and interactive events.

# Camping with us

It's important that we create a community, not just a camp, an all campers play an important role in this.

* **Work Shifts:** All campers are expected to do 3 work shifts over the course of the week to keep things running smoothly. Please show up on time, get shit done, and if you miss a shift please offer to pick up another.
* **Camp dues:** The sexy amenities (see below) cost money, so we all pitch in to make sure it works. These dues are determined every year based on budget and how much carry-over we have from the previous year.
* *Participation:* Come hang out with us and help make the camp events awesome.
* **Camp tear down:** By the end of the week, everybody is tired and just wants to leave. But before we can, we have to tear down the camp, pack everything up and make sure there's absolutely no moop left behind. Everyone in camp is involved in tear down. If you're leaving before the weekend, talk to one of the camp leads to see what you can do to make their tear down easier.
* **Departure:** Departure process for each person should be:
  * Check lost and found for personal items
  * Take 1 bag of trash and 1 bag of recycling per car
  * Do a final thorough moop sweep of your tent area


# Sexy Camp Amenities

* **Communal space:** We’re offering a front “courtyard” area for events and to welcome guests. Other burners are welcome to come hang out in that area. Go make friends. We also have a private back of house area (behind the backdrops) just for campers. Please feel free to bring stuff that you think would make the area more comfy and homey.
* **Breakfast and Dinner:** Basically that. Breakfast ingredients will be available for you to consume in the mornings, and we’ll have a communal camp dinner every night.
* **Kitchen:** Our kitchen set up has shelving for communal food, coolers for communal frozen/cold stuff to share with the camp (typically, full of beer donations), three large burners, a motley assortment of cooking implements, knives, etc. and a dish washing station.
* **Tent Shade:** Your puny tent is no match for the Playa sun, but under our massive shade structure, you should be able to happily snooze until, like, 9.
* **Drinking Water:** We provide drinking water for the camp during the burn. They’ll be held in big-ass barrels in the container. This is not water for showers, which you should bring yourself. Please also pack 5 gallons of emergency water for gate line, or in case there of other issues.
* **Greywater disposal:** We have a 250 gal greywater container in the back of camp. Please feel free to use this to dispose of toothpastey/washy/kitchen/warm beer type liquids. Please no bodily fluids. Sometimes I feel like a wimp for having this but then I’m out there and don’t have to carry gallons of gross toothpaste water home and I nearly cry with relief.
* **Shower:** For when you feel like being clean for, like, 5 min. Bring your own camping solar shower bag and conserve water when you shower. Please be warned, the shower stall is cursed--inevitably within an hour of someone showering, a dust storm kicks up.
* **Power:** The camp has a gas powered generator that will be running in the evening for camp lighting. We’ll have an area to plug in anything that needs to be charged, but please be courteous and remove your stuff when it’s done charging so everybody can have at it. The generator is not guaranteed for personal use swamp coolers,AC units, hitachi personal massager, etc. If you want to use it for high-power personal items, please consult the power team lead first.

# Other Things to Know
* **Transportation to the playa:** Don’t have a vehicle pass to the burn? No biggie. Use the Burner Express.
* **Camp Events:** The camp will be having a series of events during the week. If you’re not working the event, you don’t have to be there, but we’d love for you to join the fun. If you are working the event, please remember to always check ID.
* **Trash / Can Recycling / Compost / Burnables:** We’ll have cans in the camp for each of these. Please compress anything you put into these as much as possible, . Recyclables will be taken to the recycling camp, and compostable/burnable things will be put in the burn barrel. Anybody caught throwing non-burnable stuff in the burn barrel will be obliged to sit on it while it is lit and while they recite the 10 Principles from memory. You have been warned.
* **Departure:** By the end of the week, everybody is tired and just wants to leave. Please be sure to help tear down any structures that need it per the set up and tear down checklist, so that you don’t leave the last 2 people on Playa with an insane amount of work. Departure process for each person should be:
  * Check lost and found for personal items
  * Take 1 bag of trash and 1 bag of recycling per car
  * Do a final thorough moop sweep of your tent area
* **Ice, Ice, Baby:** If you expect to want ice for your cooler or beverages, etc., bring cash. It's $4 per bag, which you can get crushed ice or cubed ice. Cubed lasts longer, crushed is more convenient. Pro tip: bring large plastic freezer bags to keep your ice in and then when it melts you end up with ice cold clean drinking water. Cheers! . Ice runs will be incorporated into camp work shifts
* **Food:** Lunch is a fend-for-yourselves kind of deal (don’t worry, there are lots of places to find food on your adventures during the day). Snacks are also BYO, however we ask that everyone bring beverage and snacks to share with the camp! Bring anything you might desire, from cheese balls to celery and peanut butter to shitty beer to fine champagne to whatever. Salty snacks are amazing on playa.
