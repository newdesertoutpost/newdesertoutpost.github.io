We've been working hard to create a new camp which is unique and fun. Here's some pics from some of the things we've been making.

## Sign

When you see this, you know you're here.

Our lovely, old-timey, burn barrel.

## Electric torches

These rugged torches flicker as if they are really burning and provide a wild and inviting entrance to our camp.

## Wooden crates

They store our stuff while providing a fun antique feeling to the camp.
